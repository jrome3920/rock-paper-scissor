## What is Rock Paper Scissor?

Rock-paper-scissors is a hand game for two players. Each player forms either a rock (fist), paper (open hand), or scissors (fist with index and middle fingers outstretched). Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock; ties occur if both choose the same shape.

## Gameplay and Rules

The game can be played in a single round or in a series of rounds, with the first player to win a predetermined number of rounds declared the overall winner. Its simplicity and universality have made rock-paper-scissors a timeless classic enjoyed by people of all ages around the world.
