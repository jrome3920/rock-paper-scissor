        <h1>WHAT IS ROCK PAPER SCISSOR?</h1>
        <p>Rock-paper-scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people where each player simultaneously
            forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand: rock (a fist), paper (an open hand), or scissors (a
            fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). The outcome of the game is determined by the
            chosen shapes, with rock defeating scissors, scissors defeating paper, and paper defeating rock; if both
            players choose the same shape, the game is a tie.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>ORIGIN AND HISTORY</h1>
        <p>The origins of rock-paper-scissors are somewhat murky, but the game likely originated in China around 200
            B.C. as "shoushiling." From there, it spread to Japan, where it was known as "jan-ken" or "janken." The game
            eventually made its way to the Western world, becoming popular globally as a simple yet entertaining way to
            make quick decisions or settle disputes.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>GAMEPLAY AND RULES</h1>
        <p>To play, both players count to three in unison and simultaneously reveal their chosen shape. The winner of
            each round is determined by the rules mentioned earlier. The game can be played in a single round or in a
            series of rounds, with the first player to win a predetermined number of rounds declared the overall winner.
            Its simplicity and universality have made rock-paper-scissors a timeless classic enjoyed by people of all
            ages around the world.</p>
